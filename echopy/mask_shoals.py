    Mask shoals as in "Weill et al. (1993): MOVIES-B â€” an acoustic detection 
    description software . Application to shoal species' classification".
    
    Contiguous Sv samples above a given threshold will be considered as shoals,
    as long as they meet the following contiguity laws:
        
        * Vertical contiguity: along-ping gaps are allowed to some extent. 
        Tipically, no more than the number of samples equivalent to half of the
        pulse length.
        
        * Horizontal contiguity: above-threshold features from contiguous pings
        will be regarded as the same shoal if there is at least one sample in
        each ping at the same range depth.          
          
    Shoals shorter than a user-defined number of pings will be ruled out.
    
    Args:
        Sv (float): 2D numpy array with Sv data (dB).
        r (float): 1D numpy array with range data (m).
        thr (int): Sv threshold (dB).
        maxvgap (int): maximum vertical gap allowed (n samples).
        minlength (int): minimum length for a shoal to be eligible (n pings).
        
    Returns:
        bool: 2D mask with shoals identified.
