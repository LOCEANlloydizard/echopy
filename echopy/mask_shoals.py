    Detects and masks shoals following the algorithm decribed in:
        
        "Weill et al. (1993): MOVIES-B â€” an acoustic detection description
        software . Application to shoal species' classification".
    
    Contiguous Sv samples above a given threshold will be considered as the
    same shoal, as long as it meets the contiguity criteria described by Weill
    et al. (1993):
        
        * Vertical contiguity: along-ping gaps are allowed to some extent. 
        Tipically, no more than the number of samples equivalent to half of the
        pulse length.
        
        * Horizontal contiguity: above-threshold features from contiguous pings
        will be regarded as the same shoal if there is at least one sample in
        each ping at the same range depth.
        
    Although the default settings strictly complies with Weill's contiguity
    criteria, other contiguity arguments has been enabled in this function to
    increase operability. For instance, the posibility to link non-contiguous
    pings to certain extent, or to set minimum vertical and horizontal lengths
    for a feature to be regarded as a shoal.
    
    Args:
        Sv (float): 2D numpy array with Sv data (dB).
        r (float): 1D numpy array with range data (m).
        thr (int): Sv threshold (dB).
        maxvgap (int): maximum vertical gap allowed (n samples).
        maxhgap (int): maximum horizontal gap allowed (n pings).
        minvlen (int): minimum vertical length for a shoal to be eligible
                       (n samples).
        minhlen (int): minimum horizontal length for a shoal to be eligible
                       (n pings).
        start (int): ping index to start processing. If greater than cero, it
                     means that Sv carries data from a preceeding file and the
                     the algorithm needs to know where to start processing.
        
    Returns:
        bool: 2D mask with shoals identified.
